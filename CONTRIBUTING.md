# Contributing to Open NoiseNet

**üö® SEEKING CONTRIBUTORS & SPONSORS üö®**

Open NoiseNet is currently in the **concept and planning phase** - we're looking for passionate contributors and sponsors to help bring this vision to life!

## üéØ What is Open NoiseNet?

Open NoiseNet is an ambitious open-source project to democratize environmental noise monitoring through affordable DIY devices. We're building a global network of citizen-operated noise sensors that will:

- Enable communities to measure and document noise pollution
- Provide data for advocacy and policy change
- Create the world's first open, crowd-sourced noise pollution map
- Empower citizens with affordable (~‚Ç¨30-45) monitoring devices

## üîç Project Status

**We're currently seeking:**
- **Core developers** to implement the initial MVP
- **Hardware engineers** familiar with ESP32 and MEMS microphones  
- **Backend developers** experienced with FastAPI/PostgreSQL
- **Frontend developers** skilled in React and mapping libraries
- **Community organizers** to coordinate contributors and outreach
- **Sponsors** to fund initial prototyping and infrastructure

**No code has been written yet** - this is your chance to shape the project from the ground up!
