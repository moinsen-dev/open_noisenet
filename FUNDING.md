Top funding routes (EU → DE)

1) EU LIFE Programme — “Circular Economy & Zero Pollution → Noise” (2025 call)
	•	LIFE explicitly lists “2.4 Noise” as a priority under Zero Pollution (aiming at noise reduction in densely populated urban areas). Projects can be close-to-market and must show replication potential. Funding rate: up to 60% for Standard Action Projects; typical project size €2–10M; deadline 23 Sept 2025; results Feb/Mar 2026.  ￼
Fit: OpenNoiseNet as a city-scale demonstration: citizen nodes + privacy-preserving event detection feeding city action plans.
What you need: a city (or two) as beneficiaries, a university/SME for acoustics + on-device AI, and a clear plan to integrate with Environmental Noise Directive actions.  ￼ ￼

2) Germany — DBU (Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt)
	•	Rolling project grants for innovative, model environmental solutions. Grants are non-repayable; public HEIs can receive up to 100% of project costs; others co-finance (DBU expects an own contribution). Two-step process: short “Projektskizze” → full proposal.  ￼
Fit: Pilot in one Land or municipality; focus on health-relevant noise evidence and citizen participation; open-source stack and transferability.

3) Germany — mFUND (BMDV) for data-driven mobility
	•	Supports digital, data-based mobility/urban-infrastructure projects. Line 1: up to €200k / 24 months; Line 2: up to €3M / 36 months. Grants are non-repayable, usually co-funded; strong Open Data/Open Source expectations and a required data-management plan.  ￼
Fit: Traffic-noise analytics, hotspot detection, and planning tools; integrate with municipal mobility data and publish non-personal outputs.

4) Germany — Prototype Fund (BMBF via OKF DE)
	•	For FOSS prototypes addressing societal needs. Up to €47,500 over 6 months for individuals/small teams; multiple rounds per year.  ￼
Fit: Fund the Android/iOS node MVP, on-device AI pipeline, calibration wizard, and public docs.

5) EU — EIT Urban Mobility (innovation open calls)
	•	Funds real-life city pilots that improve liveability; annual calls invite projects with city partners and a route to adoption/commercialisation. Check 2025 “Main/Strategic Innovation” calls.  ￼
Fit: Co-pilot with willing cities, measure impact on sleep/complaints, and package a deployable service for municipalities.

6) Watchlist — BMBF Citizen-Science lines
	•	BMBF ran two national Citizen-Science funding rounds (2021–2024); programme is being evaluated through April 2025—often a prelude to a refreshed call. Stay close to updates and networks.  ￼ ￼

Where this has been funded before (precedent helps)
	•	Cities Health (H2020): citizen science on air & noise in five EU cities.  ￼
	•	EU’s LIFE work programme explicitly funds noise actions (see above).  ￼

Quick “how to win” playbook (tailored to OpenNoiseNet)

A) Choose your path(s)
	•	LIFE demo (EU-level, €2–10M): Two-city pilot, integrate with END action plans, target exposure reduction KPIs and replication to 10+ cities.  ￼
	•	DBU (DE, rolling): Smaller national pilot that de-risks tech and community ops; position as model project with transfer to other Länder.  ￼
	•	mFUND (DE, €200k–€3M): Frame as mobility data innovation (traffic-noise intelligence, hotspot early warning, open APIs).  ￼
	•	Prototype Fund (DE, €47.5k): Finance the OSS MVP fast; then leverage results in bigger calls.  ￼

B) Assemble the minimum consortium
	•	City(ies): environment + mobility + health departments (letters of commitment).
	•	University/Institute: acoustics + public health evaluation.
	•	Open-source tech: you as lead or co-lead; commit to no raw audio, event-only telemetry.
	•	Civil society: tenant groups, sleep/health NGOs for recruitment and outreach.
	•	Data governance: DPO/legal partner to evidence GDPR compliance.

C) Evidence & KPIs evaluators look for
	•	Statistically robust event timelines (e.g., alarms, refuse collection, scooters) + LAeq/Lden overlays; show how this supports noise action plans and reduces exposure.  ￼
	•	Clear privacy model: no raw audio leaves device; DPIA summary; open documentation.
	•	Replication pathway: starter kit for other cities; per-device calibration approach; expected cost/household.

D) Budgeting & rates to plan
	•	LIFE: plan 40% co-financing from cities/regions/partners; budget for community engagement and independent impact evaluation; see funding rate and budget ranges in call.  ￼
	•	DBU: grants are non-repayable; public HEIs may get up to 100%; others bring own share. Start with a Projektskizze.  ￼
	•	mFUND: pick Line 1 (€≤200k) for exploratory work or Line 2 (€≤3M) for full pilots; comply with Open Data/Open Source requirements.  ￼
	•	Prototype Fund: short, focused scope; 6-month deliverables; €47.5k cap.  ￼

E) Submission timeline (near-term)
	•	LIFE 2025 SAP (Noise): open now; deadline 23 Sept 2025. Start with concept outline → partner commitments → portal submission.  ￼
	•	EIT Urban Mobility: check current 2025 windows; some close mid-year; city partner mandatory.  ￼
	•	DBU & mFUND: rolling/regular calls—prep a 2–4-page teaser for quick sponsor feedback.  ￼ ￼
	•	Prototype Fund: watch next round; prep a tight OSS story and user base.  ￼

Practical next steps (I can draft these immediately)
	1.	2-pager concept note (LIFE/DBU/mFUND-ready): problem, solution, pilot cities, privacy, metrics, replication.
	2.	Partner outreach pack: one-page city letter of commitment, roles, in-kind support.
	3.	Work plan skeleton: WP1 device app & on-device AI; WP2 calibration & QA; WP3 city pilots; WP4 evaluation (sleep/annoyance, Lden/Lnight); WP5 replication & OSS; WP6 ethics/DPIA.
	4.	Budget rough-cut (co-financing scenarios: 60/40 for LIFE; DBU/mFUND variants).
	5.	Evidence bank: prior EU citizen-noise projects and END legal basis for municipal relevance.  ￼ ￼
