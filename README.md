## The Silent Crisis: Noise Pollution is Killing Us

**Did you know that noise pollution is the second-largest environmental health risk after air pollution?** Yet unlike air quality, noise levels remain largely unmeasured, unregulated, and invisible to most communities.

### The Hidden Health Crisis

- **125 million Europeans** are exposed to harmful traffic noise levels daily
- Noise pollution causes **48,000 new cases of heart disease** annually in Europe alone
- **12,000 premature deaths** per year are linked to environmental noise
- Children in noisy environments show **impaired learning and memory development**
- Sleep disruption from noise affects **millions of people worldwide**

### The Data Desert

While we have thousands of air quality monitoring stations worldwide, **noise monitoring is virtually non-existent**:

- Most cities have **fewer than 5 noise monitoring stations** for millions of residents  
- Expensive commercial systems cost **€10,000-50,000** per unit
- Data is often **proprietary, limited, or completely unavailable** to citizens
- Communities suffering from noise pollution have **no evidence** to support policy changes

**This is where Open NoiseNet comes in.**

## 🌍 Our Vision: Democratizing Noise Monitoring

**Open NoiseNet** is an ambitious open-source project to create the world's first **global, citizen-powered noise monitoring network**.

### What We're Building

🔧 **Affordable Hardware**
- DIY noise monitoring devices for **€30-45** (vs €10,000+ commercial units)
- ESP32-based with MEMS microphones and weather-resistant enclosures
- Solar power options for remote deployment

📡 **Smart Software**
- Real-time sound level processing and A-weighted measurements
- Machine learning for noise source classification (traffic, construction, alarms)
- Pattern detection for recurring noise events

🗺️ **Open Data Platform**
- Global noise pollution map with real-time data
- Open data exports for researchers and policymakers  
- Community dashboards for local advocacy

⚖️ **Privacy-First Design**
- Numeric sound levels only (no audio recording by default)
- GDPR-compliant with full user control
- Optional encrypted audio snippets for classification

### The Impact

With your help, Open NoiseNet will:

✊ **Empower Communities** - Give citizens the data they need to fight noise pollution
📊 **Enable Research** - Provide scientists with unprecedented noise pollution datasets
🏛️ **Drive Policy** - Create evidence for noise regulations and urban planning
🌐 **Build Awareness** - Make the invisible problem of noise pollution visible to all
