- **Image Optimization**: Proper asset loading and fallbacks

### Assets Required
**Story Images** (existing):
- `/public/images/story/onn-1.png` through `onn-7.png`

**Technology Images** (to be created from specifications):
- `/public/images/technology/tech-4.png` through `tech-10.png`

## Content Strategy

### Dual Narrative Approach
The landing page uses a **complementary narrative structure**:

| **Emotional Story** | **Technology Story** |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Problem: Noise disrupts sleep | Solution: Device transformation |
| Impact: Personal suffering | Method: Privacy-first architecture |
| Frustration: Helplessness | Intelligence: Edge AI classification |
| Pattern: Recurring disruption | Analysis: Temporal pattern detection |
| Community: Shared experience | Network: Distributed sensing |
| Need: Evidence for change | Evidence: Analytics and reporting |
| Hope: Quieter future | Impact: Measurable improvement |

### Conversion Funnel
1. **Awareness** (Story Page): Emotional connection to the problem
2. **Interest** (Technology Page): Technical credibility and innovation
3. **Desire** (CTAs): Clear path to participation
4. **Action** (Get Started): Device setup and community joining

## Development Status

### âœ… Completed
- [x] Story page with emotional narrative
- [x] Technology page with solution narrative
